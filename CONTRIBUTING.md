Reporting bugs
==============

Use GitHub Bug Tracker :

* Check if there is already a similar issue
* Explain the situation you are experiencing
* Explain what you expected
* Give some context :
    * Apache and PHP versions
    * Browser name and version

Coding style
============

This coding style is inspired by the Python PEP8 style.

* Indentation is 4 spaces
* An empty line before each function (or before comments of the function)
* Lines must not exceed 100 characters and should be below 90 characters
* Opening curly braces are at the end of the line of the statement that creates the block
* Closing curly braces are always alone on their line (even before `else`)
* Functions should not use `echo`, but return strings
